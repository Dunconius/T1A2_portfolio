                    <p>Hi, my name is Duncan.</p>
                    <p>
                        I am a budding web developer, eager to dive into the world of creating amazing online experiences. With a hunger for learning and a keen eye for detail, I'm here to share the web projects I've been working on as I grow my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my previous career(s) I have been an iterior designer, teacher, and 3D digital  artist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2015-16 I was studying 3D modelling and animation at AIE. During this time I did a deep dive into character rigging and taught myself how to use Python (within Maya) for this purposed. It was great fun writing code to build machines that did the tedious work for me. My high point was creating an automated character rigging interface that built skeletons and applied control rigs with the push of a button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the past few years I have been dabbling in web design and have built several websites (including one for a paying client) using <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Webflow.</u></strong></a> This has given me a great understanding of the <em>physyical</em> structure of HTML but seen through a graphical user interface. This has helped me a lot in the first few weeks at CoderAcademy as I already have a strong understanding of HTML elements, flex-box, and styling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's a link to my 3D portfolio website. It's simple but effective and presents some of my architectural visualisation projects.
